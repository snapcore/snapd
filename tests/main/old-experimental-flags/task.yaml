summary: Ensure that old experimental flag configs are removed

details: |
    Check that experimental flag configs that used to exist but now
    are out of experimental are removed from snapd state.

prepare: |
    snap install --devmode jq

restore: |
    snap remove jq

execute: |
    echo "Check that users cannot set unsupported experimental features"
    snap set core experimental.old-flag=true 2>&1 | MATCH "unsupported system option"
    snap get core experimental.old-flag | NOMATCH "true"

    # Stop snapd while editing state.json manually
    systemctl stop snapd.service snapd.socket

    echo "Force setting the unsupported experimental.old-flag"
    # This simulates the situation where an experimental feature got out
    # of experimental after a snapd refresh and now is an unsupported config
    jq '.data.config.core.experimental += {"old-flag": true}' /var/lib/snapd/state.json > state.json
    mv state.json /var/lib/snapd/state.json
    echo "Check that experimental.old-flag is persisted in state.json"
    jq '.data.config.core.experimental."old-flag"' /var/lib/snapd/state.json | MATCH "true"

    echo "Starting snapd should clean old experimental flags"
    systemctl start snapd.service snapd.socket
    snap get core experimental.old-flag | NOMATCH "true"
    jq '.data.config.core.experimental."old-flag"' /var/lib/snapd/state.json | MATCH "null"
